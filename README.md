# Word-Detection-and-Sentence-Generation-Using-YOLOv8-and-Stable-Diffusion
This project combines real-time object detection and sentence generation by using YOLOv8 for object detection and Stable Diffusion for image generation. The system detects words in real-time from a webcam feed, identifies the most repeated word, and generates a sentence using the detected words.
